        <h1>Pig (dice game)🎲</h1>
        <p>
          Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled
          or the player decides to "hold": If the player rolls a 1, they score
          nothing and it becomes the next player's turn. If the player rolls any
          other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn
          continues. If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to
          their score, and it becomes the next player's turn. The first player
          to score 100 or more points wins. For example, the first player,
          Donald, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Donald could hold and score 5
          points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 2, and could hold
          with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls
          a 1, and must end his turn without scoring. The next player, Alexis,
          rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-6, after which she chooses to hold, and
          adds her turn total of 23 points to her score.
